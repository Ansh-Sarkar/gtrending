# `gtrending`

Lightweight and easy-to-use python library for fetching
trending repositories and developers. Relies on
[github-trending-api](https://github.com/huchenme/github-trending-api)
which is in JavaScript, so gtrending aims to fill the gap
for python.

### Requirements
* Python 3.6 or higher


### Installation
```
pip3 install gtrending
```
